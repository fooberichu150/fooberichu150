# Welcome

Hi, I'm Jon Seeley. I blog at [www.seeleycoder.com](https://www.seeleycoder.com/) about whatever programming topic strikes my fancy--usually related to .NET Core.  I try to make it weekly but I'm married and have 5 kids. The posts happen when they happen. :)

Feel free to [reach out to me](https://www.seeleycoder.com/contact) with questions, suggestions, or whatever.
